# CivVoxelMap

This is a 'fork' of [VoxelMap](https://modrinth.com/mod/voxelmap-updated) for 1.20.1 that's [CivMC](https://civmc.net)
legal.

## Changes

- CivMC bans Cave Mode outside the Nether so is now disabled by default. Also added a warning to the option button
  of the feature's illegality.

- CivMC bans reading entity equipment so player and mob helmets no longer appear in radar by default. Also added a
  warning to the option buttons of the feature's illegality.

- CivMC bans reading entity elevation so players and mobs are no longer darkened or faded by how far above or above they
  are from you. Also added a warning to the option button of the feature's illegality.

- Added a fair-play option to disable seeing crouched entities in your radar.

- Added a fair-play option to disable seeing invisible entities in your radar.

- Specific player/mob radar options now have their own screens, just click the cog icon.

- Prevents VoxelMap rendering its smaller/pixelated waypoint icons.

- Allows players to ESC out of choosing waypoint colours and icons.
