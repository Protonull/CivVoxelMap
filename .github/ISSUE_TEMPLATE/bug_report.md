**What's the issue?**
Please write a clear description of the issue. Anything along the lines of "it doesn't work" will do little to nothing to tell us what's wrong, or gauge how to fix it. Please be descriptive. If you've got any stack traces, screenshots, or screen recordings of the issue, please include them here.

**To Reproduce**
Are you able to reliably reproduce this? If so, how? Or otherwise, what particular steps did you take when you encountered the issue?

**Narrowing down**
Did you check whether you get the same issue with vanilla VoxelMap, or on a clean client with only CivVoxelMap and its required dependencies? This helps greatly in determining whether it's specifically a CivVoxelMap addition that's causing the issue, or a buggy interaction with other mods, etc.

**Versions**
What version of Minecraft, Fabric, Fabric API, and CivVoxelMap are you using?
